# Project-Web-App-for-Simon-Game
Using Javascript, a pattern recognition game has been implemented through a web application. This game requires the user to remember the pattern for the levels to progress further. Sounds have been included to make it seem more interesting. Wrong pattern results in "Game over" scenario and user has to start from scratch.
